## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EsUxVxSQRz), or via email to [devteam@frogatto.com](mailto:devteam@frogatto.com).

We will do our best to respond in a timely manner to any issues, but as an unpaid volunteer group we can offer no guarantees of timely fixes or any sort of monetary reward. You'll just have our gratitude, _especially_ if you submit a PR with a fix.

Note: Runnig arbitrary mods is _not secure_ at the moment. Some work could be done in that area, but generally running a mod (such as `frogatto4` or `citadel`) is the security equivalent of running a binary.
